# PRO1 Programming Problems Solutions

## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of C++ solutions for programming problems, likely from the PRO1 course at UPC FIB.

## Folder Structure
*   `pro1/S<number>/`: Contains solutions for problems from different sessions (e.g., `S7`, `S8`).
*   `pro1/p<number>/`: Contains solutions for specific problems, often grouped by topic or session.
*   `pro1/controls<number>/`: Contains solutions for control exercises or exams.
*   `pro1/conso<number>/`: Contains solutions for consolidation exercises.
*   `pro1/TeoriaPro1/`: Contains theoretical materials like lecture slides (PDFs) and related documents.
*   `pro1/algorithms/`: Contains implementations of various fundamental algorithms.

## How to Compile and Run
*   Most solutions are single C++ files (e.g., `problem_name.cc`).
*   You'll need a C++ compiler (like g++) to compile them.
*   General compilation command: `g++ problem_name.cc -o problem_name.x`
*   General execution: `./problem_name.x`
*   Many problems expect input from standard input and produce output to standard output. You can use redirection: `./problem_name.x < input_file.dat > output_file.dat`
*   Some problems might have associated `.x` executable files and `.dat` or `.inp` sample input files.

## Disclaimer
These are student solutions submitted for various assignments and exams. While they aim to be correct, they might not always represent the most optimal or polished approach. Use them as a reference or for learning purposes.


## Demo Program

A simple demo program (`p1-norm.cc` from session S7) is available in the `demo` directory.
It includes a sample input file and a `README_DEMO.md` with specific instructions on how to compile and run it.
This can serve as a quick example of how to work with the programs in this repository.
