# Problem 45829

## Problem Description

Process input data according to specific algorithmic requirements.
- Works with sequences/arrays of data
- Uses nested iteration (possibly for matrix/grid operations)

*For exact requirements, refer to the solution code in this directory.*

## Input Format

- Multiple test cases (read until end of input)
- First line: an integer `n` (number of elements)
- Next: `n` values to process

## Output Format

- Output results, one per line

## Approach

- Uses: vector
- Algorithm: nested loops / matrix operations, loop until condition

## Solution

The solution is implemented in `45829.cc`.
