# Problem 67340

## Problem Description

Process input data according to specific algorithmic requirements.
- Works with sequences/arrays of data
- Uses nested iteration (possibly for matrix/grid operations)

*For exact requirements, refer to the solution code in this directory.*

## Input Format

- First line: an integer `n` (number of elements)
- Next: `n` values to process

## Output Format

- Output results, one per line

## Approach

- Uses: vector
- Algorithm: nested loops / matrix operations, loop until condition
- Helper functions: find_threats_direction, find_threats

## Solution

The solution is implemented in `67340.cc`.
