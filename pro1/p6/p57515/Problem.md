# Problem p57515

## Problem Description

Process input data according to specific algorithmic requirements.
- Uses nested iteration (possibly for matrix/grid operations)

*For exact requirements, refer to the solution code in this directory.*

## Input Format

- Multiple test cases (read until end of input)

## Output Format

- Output results, one per line

## Approach

- Algorithm: nested loops / matrix operations, loop until condition
- Helper functions: xifres, rotacio_dreta

## Solution
