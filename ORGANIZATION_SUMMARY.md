# Repository Organization Summary

This document summarizes the improvements made to organize and clean up the PRO1 repository.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added .gitignore File
Created a comprehensive `.gitignore` file to prevent build artifacts and temporary files from being committed:
- Compiled executables: `*.x`, `*.out`, `*.exe`
- Object files: `*.o`, `*.obj`
- Library files: `*.so`, `*.a`, `*.dylib`, `*.dll`
- Editor temporary files: `*~`, `*.swp`, `.DS_Store`
- IDE-specific files: `.vscode/`, `.idea/`
- Build directories: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`

### 2. Removed Build Artifacts
**Deleted 162 executable files** (`.x` files) that were tracked in version control but should not be committed:
- These are generated during compilation and can be recreated anytime
- Examples: `p12345.x`, `x67890.x`
- The `.gitignore` file now prevents them from being committed again

### 3. Removed Duplicate/Backup Files
**Deleted 9 duplicate source files** with non-standard names:
- `mine.cc`, `mi.cc` - personal backup versions
- `resguard.cc`, `res.cc` - backup copies
- `solu.cc` - solution backups
- These caused confusion about which file was the actual solution

### 4. Removed Empty Files
**Deleted 4 empty or placeholder files** that contained no meaningful code:
- `pro1/conso1/p19724/p19724.cc`
- `pro1/conso2/p57846/p57846.cc`
- `pro1/conso2/x33736/x33736.cc`
- `pro1/p4/x51086/x51086.cc`

### 5. Enhanced Documentation

#### Updated README.md
- Expanded folder structure explanation with detailed descriptions
- Added clear compilation and execution examples with code blocks
- Improved formatting and organization
- Added contributing guidelines section
- Added repository maintenance section

#### Created CONTRIBUTING.md
New comprehensive guide for contributors including:
- File organization guidelines
- Code quality standards
- What not to commit
- Commit message guidelines
- Academic integrity reminders

### 6. Added Maintenance Script
Created `cleanup.sh` - an executable script that:
- Scans for build artifacts (executables, object files, temp files)
- Provides a count before cleanup
- Asks for confirmation before deleting
- Removes unnecessary files to keep the repository clean
- Can be run anytime to clean up after compilation

## Impact

### Before
- 162 executable files tracked in git
- 9 duplicate/backup source files
- 4 empty placeholder files
- Minimal documentation
- No .gitignore file

### After
- 0 executable files (all removed, future ones ignored)
- Clean source files (one solution per problem)
- Only meaningful code files
- Comprehensive documentation
- Proper .gitignore configuration
- Maintenance tools in place

## Repository Statistics

### File Organization
- **Session problems** (S7-S11): ~50 files
- **Topic problems** (p1-p10): ~200 files
- **Control exercises**: ~40 files
- **Consolidation exercises**: ~30 files
- **Theory materials**: ~35 folders with examples
- **Algorithms**: 14 fundamental algorithm implementations

### Total Source Files
Approximately **334 C++ source files** (.cc files) organized across the directory structure.

## Usage Instructions

### For Developers
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the problem directory
3. Compile: `g++ problem.cc -o problem.x`
4. Run: `./problem.x < input.inp`
5. The `.x` file won't be committed (thanks to .gitignore)

### For Maintainers
1. Run `./cleanup.sh` periodically to remove build artifacts
2. Follow guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md` when adding new solutions
3. Keep one primary solution per problem
4. Don't commit executables or backup files

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Repository**: Focus on source code, not build artifacts
2. **Better Organization**: Clear structure and naming conventions
3. **Easier Collaboration**: Guidelines prevent common mistakes
4. **Reduced Size**: Removed 162 unnecessary executable files
5. **Improved Documentation**: Easier for new users to understand and contribute
6. **Maintainability**: Tools and processes for keeping the repo clean

## Next Steps (Optional Future Improvements)

1. Consider adding example problem statements for reference
2. Add automated testing scripts for solutions
3. Create a compilation script to build multiple problems at once
4. Add performance benchmarks for algorithm implementations
5. Consider organizing problems by difficulty level or topic tags

This organization effort makes the repository more professional, maintainable, and user-friendly for students learning C++ programming in the PRO1 course.
